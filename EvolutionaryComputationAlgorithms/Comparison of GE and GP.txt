LoG is the no of binary string that is there in the entire string which is converted into random numbers.

UPoG : Each number in this Genome is a 8-bit number, so the used portion of the genome means only those individuals needed to map everything.

Depth of tree - 13 whereas max depth initialized is 35, so noteven half of it used.only a small portion of it is being used.

This is a good individual since it has used very less no of codons to map everything out.
It has got the best fitness of 0.0, it has used less no of codons and it has also got less depth.

Compare GP vs GE in two things -
1. Best(max) fitness of GP / GE
2. Avg Fitness of GP /GE
3. Size of Individiuals ( in GP - length of tree / no of nodes in tree , in GE - how many codons you are using)

change the range scale for graph. 

check at what generation each of them are getting the best individual (Convergence), what is the avg fitness of both of these approaches.

adv of using GE - no of codons -> gives a small size of individual saving a lot of memory
