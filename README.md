# Evolutionary-Computation
Acknowledged the difference between intelligence &amp; learning, strong &amp; weak AI. Helped recognize the evolutionary algorithms and the differences between them, to choose the appropriate EA based on the specific application requirements &amp; modify various parameters to enhance performance. Applied the use of EAs for ML problem statement &amp; for robotics.
